# SeleniumGuiAutomation
This project automates a redundant web-based business task using Python, Selenium, and Tkinter. It features a GUI-based tool that allows users to log in, navigate web forms, and input inventory data automatically, eliminating manual data entry.

🔧 Features:
- ✅ GUI-Driven Automation – Users interact with an intuitive Tkinter GUI to input feed details before automation starts.
- ✅ Dynamic Form Handling – Automatically detects and fills web forms based on input selections.
- ✅ Intelligent Data Mapping – Uses conditional logic to map and input fields based on the selected provider.
- ✅ Error Handling & Smart Retries – Implements timeouts, retries, and exception handling to prevent failures.
- ✅ Session Management – Prevents redundant logins and resumes execution if the session is still active.
- ✅ Logging & Debugging – Tracks execution progress and errors in real time for easy troubleshooting.
- ✅ Restart & Refresh Capabilities – Built-in reset button allows users to quickly restart the process without manually relaunching the script.
